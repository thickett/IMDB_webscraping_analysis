# IMDB_webscraping_analysis
## Project overview
An all encompassing project where I scrape, clean, manipulate and engineer data to create a predictive model that can successfully predict movie IMDB ratings based off of a number of predictor variables. 


The project was split into three main sections:
### 1) Web Scraping 
* Created from scratch a web scraper in R that could:
  * Successfully scrape data from multiple pages and subpages. 
  * Collate the collected data into a tidy dataframe.
* Produced a simple web scraper for currency convertion rates for data cleaning.

### 2) Data Cleaning
* Extracted important information from complex strings to create tidy, informative variables using custom made functions.
* Feature engineered new variables to present the data in a more meaningful way.
* Made decisions on how to correctly navigate missing and incorrect data.
* Ensured data integrity was maintained throughout.
